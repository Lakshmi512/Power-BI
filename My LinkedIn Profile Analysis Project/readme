Hi Everyone,



Today I am sharing 'My LinkedIn Profile Analysis Dashboard' with all of you.



Problem Statement: Create a Dashboard while performing the analysis of your LinkedIn profile data.



Steps involved in Resolving the Problem Statement: -



1st :- Download your own profile Dataset(that I'll take 24 hrs.).

2nd:- Analyze all the Datasets.

3rd: - Select the Datasets according to your need for your profile analysis.

4th: - Do the Data Cleaning & Data Transformation according to your need.

5th: - Upload it into the Power BI.

6th: - Use Power Query for further Data Transformations which will help you to build the visuals that you require for the dashboard.

7th: - Compile all your visuals into a single Dashboard.



Tools used by me : Power Bi , MS-Excel
